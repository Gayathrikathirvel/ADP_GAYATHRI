       <h3><b>Archaelogy:</b></h3>
       <p>Archaeology is the scientific study of past human cultures through the systematic recovery, analysis, and interpretation of material remains, such as:<br>

            - <strong>Artifacts</strong> (tools, pottery, jewelry)<br>
            - <strong>Architecture</strong> (buildings, monuments)<br>
            - <strong>Cultural landscapes</strong> (settlements, tombs)<br>

        <h3><b>Role of Archaelogists:</b></h3>
            Archaeologists study human prehistory and history, from the development of the first stone tools at Lomekwi in East Africa 3.3 million years ago up until recent decades. Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology, which is the study of fossil remains. Archaeology is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies, for which, by definition, there are no written records. Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past, from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies around the world.[1] Archaeology has various goals, which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time. Derived from Greek, the term archaeology means "the study of ancientÂ history".
